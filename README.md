# Flight Delay Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

Business air travel is essential part of managing a company successfully and the economy in general even with the availability of feature rich remote working software, such as WebEx, Zoom, and Slack that enable teams to work together while being physically apart. According to David Brown founder and CEO of  TechStars, business travel is essential to running a successful business because face to face interactions cannot be replaced. Remote work groups and individuals “start to become too far removed from the business objective” without periodic face to face communication that requires business travel. [1] A study published in Harvard business review found that in person requests were 34 time more effective then those made by text or email and suggested that a manager “could be a more effective communicator by having conversations in person.” [2] In another study, done by Harvard business school’s Growth Lab, found that “that business travel actually causes economic growth.” The research stated that business travel by US companies added 1.07% to the global GDP (142 Trillion 2019) [3] which amounted to 1.5 Trillion dollars in 2019. [4] From the airline industry’s perspective, their financial stability is heavily depended on the revenue from the business traveler. Only 12% of airline passengers are business travelers, but they represent up to 75% of an airline’s profit [5].


Flight delay have a significant effect on the productivity of businesses and the economy Research by the FAA found that “inefficiency in the air transportation sector increases the cost of doing business for other sectors, making the associated business less productive.” [6] The overall cost of flight delays including reduced GDP and increased airline operating costs for 2018 was $28 billion dollars. [7] The significant negative impact of flight delays on economic productivity and airline operating codes is further supported by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics which show that on average 18.33% of all flights between 2011 and 2019 were delayed. When Canceled flights are added in, the cumulative data shows that on average 20% of flights failed to make their destination on time or at all. [8]. This mean that a business traveler will be delayed from arriving at their destination on time every one out of five flights.

Given how integral business travel is to business success and the overall economy's GDP and how flight delays have a significant negative affect on both, predicting when  flight delays will occur so that businesses travel can be scheduled when the probability of a delayed flight is low, will enable businesses to minimize the lost productivity due to flight delays and minimize the negative effect of flight delays on GDP output.
