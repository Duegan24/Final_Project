# Flight Delay Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

Business air travel is essential part of managing a company successfully and the economy in general even with the availability of feature rich remote working software, such as WebEx, Zoom, and Slack that enable teams to work together while being physically apart. According to David Brown founder and CEO of  TechStars, business travel is essential to running a successful business because face to face interactions cannot be replaced. Remote work groups and individuals “start to become too far removed from the business objective” without periodic face to face communication that requires business travel. [1] A study published in Harvard business review found that in person requests were 34 time more effective then those made by text or email and suggested that a manager “could be a more effective communicator by having conversations in person.” [2] In another study, done by Harvard business school’s Growth Lab, found that “that business travel actually causes economic growth.” The research stated that business travel by US companies added 1.07% to the global GDP (142 Trillion 2019) [3] which amounted to 1.5 Trillion dollars in 2019. [4] 


From the airline industry’s perspective, their financial stability is heavily depended on the revenue from the business traveler. Only 12% of airline passengers are business travelers, but they represent up to 75% of an airline’s profit [5].


Flight delay have a significant effect on the productivity of businesses and significantly increase operating cost of airlines and reduce their profits. The FAA has stated in research that “inefficiency in the air transportation sector increases the cost of doing business for other sectors, making the associated business less productive.” [6] The overall cost of flight delays including airline costs and reduced GDP for 2018 was $28 billion. [7] The significant negative impact of flight delays on economic productivity and airline operating codes is further supported by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics which show that on average 18.33% of all flights that between 2011 and 2019 were delayed. When Canceled flights are added in, the cumulative data shows that on average 20% of flights failed to make their destination on time or at all. [8]. This mean that a business traveler will be delayed from arriving at their destination on time every one out of 5 flights.


Given how integral business travel is to the economy and how flight delays significantly effect economic productivity, having capacity to predict when flight delays will occur so that business travel can be scheduled to avoid these delays will enable businesses and the economy to minimize lost economic productivity due to flight delays for essential business travel.
